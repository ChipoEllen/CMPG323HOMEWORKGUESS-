# Description:
This is code cointains a game where the user has to guess a number that the program has chosen from 1 to 50.
If the guess is correct the prohgram tell the user that he/she has won the game. 
If not it tells the user to try guess again and if the number is too high or low.

# Problem-Solving Approach:

# Generate a Random Number:
I firstly have yto generate a random number within a range of 1 to 50.To do this i will use a random number generator.

# Take User Input:
Prompt the user to enter a nnumber between 1 to 50

# Compare User Guess:
Compare the player's guess with the secret number generated . Determine if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

# Provide Feedback:
Based on the comparison ,the program will provide feedback to the player. If the guess is too high or too low, it  inform the player and prompt them to guess again. If the guess is correct, it will congratulate the player and end the game.

# Repeat Until Correct Guess:
Keep looping until the player correctly guesses the secret number.
